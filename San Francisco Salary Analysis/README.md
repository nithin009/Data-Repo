# Salary Data Analysis Project

This project involves the analysis of salary data using SQL queries. The dataset (salaries) includes information such as employee names, job titles, base pay, overtime pay, total pay, benefits, and more. The analysis aims to derive insights into salary distributions, top earners, and trends across different job categories.


## Workflow
1. Data Collection
The dataset used in this project (salaries) was collected from Kaggle, which provides comprehensive records of employee salaries across various job titles and years.

2. Data Cleaning
Before analysis, the dataset underwent several data cleaning steps to ensure accuracy and consistency:

- Removal of duplicates and irrelevant records.
- Handling missing values by imputation or removal based on context.
- Standardization of data formats and units across different columns.

3. Data Ingestion
The cleaned dataset was ingested into a SQL database (salaries_db) for efficient querying and analysis.

4. Data Analysis
Using SQL queries, the following analyses were conducted:

- Basic Statistics: Counting records, calculating averages, and identifying unique values.
- Top Earners: Identifying employees with the highest total pay.
- Job Title Analysis: Analyzing salary distributions and trends across different job titles.
- Overtime Analysis: Calculating average overtime pay and its proportion to total pay.
- Yearly Trends: Analyzing average base pay trends over the years.
## Result
Results
The analysis yielded valuable insights into salary distributions, trends, and top earners across different job categories. Detailed findings are documented in the analysis report (Analysis.sql).
